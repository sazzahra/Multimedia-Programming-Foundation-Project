                        <h5>ORCH (HERO)</h5>
                        <p>Orch, a Child of Solstice, possesses the rare ability to combine the power of the 
                        sun and the moon, granting them mastery over Eclipse Magic. 
                        Born during a celestial alignment, Orch can channel and manipulate the energies of 
                        both celestial bodies. They seek to bring balance and harmony to their realm, 
                        using their powers to heal, protect, and unleash devastating cosmic energy when necessary. 
                        Orch's journey is filled with challenges as they navigate the admiration, envy,
                        and threats of factions vying for their powers. Orch's presence serves as a beacon of hope, 
                        reminding all of the harmony that can exist between the sun and moon.</p>

                        Born from primordial goo, Goo possesses the ability to transform and adapt. 
                        They provide loyal support to Orch, using their versatile nature to assist in battles 
                        and bring joy to their journey. Together, Goo and Orch exemplify the

                        <h5>FLESHMANCER (ENEMY)</h5>
                        <p>Once a promising alchemist, the Fleshmancer succumbed to 
                        forbidden knowledge and embarked on a path of twisted experimentation. 
                        Obsessed with manipulating life itself, they transmute and mold living beings 
                        into grotesque abominations. With an insatiable thirst for power, 
                        the Fleshmancer seeks to conquer realms and achieve immortality, 
                        fueled by their mastery of alchemy and their ability to reshape their own body.</p>

                        <p>Emerging from the depths of darkness, the enigmatic Shadowweaver is a master of illusion 
                        and manipulation. Cloaked in mystery, they weave a web of chaos and discord. 
                        With the power to harness shadows, the Shadowweaver ensnares their victims with 
                        illusions and traps. Their true purpose remains unknown, but their actions suggest
                        a desire to plunge the realm into eternal darkness, reveling in the power they hold 
                        over the minds of others.</p>
